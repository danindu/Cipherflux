# CipherFlux â€“ Unified Cryptoâ€¯&â€¯Vulnerability Suite

**CipherFlux** is a lightweight desktop application built with a PyQt graphical interface that bundles several cryptographic utilities and vulnerabilityâ€‘assessment tools behind one intuitive dashboard. Security engineers and enthusiasts can run quick analyses and scans without juggling multiple commandâ€‘line programs.

## Getting Started

### 1â€¯.â€¯Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danindu/cipherflux.git
cd cipherflux
```

### 2. Install Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pyqt5 -y
sudo apt-get install cmake graphviz libmpich-dev libxml2-dev mpich
pip3 install pyqt5 rsa rsactftool
```

### 3. Run

```bash
python cipherflux.py
```

## Configuration

**Module options:**  
Each builtâ€‘in utility ships with tunable parametersâ€”such as hash thresholds, iteration rounds, or RSA key sizesâ€”that let you balance speed against analytical depth. For quick reconnaissance, lower the thresholds or rounds to finish faster; for exhaustive audits, raise them to ensure every corner case is examined.

**File selection:**  
Make sure the input you feed a module matches the format it expects. For instance, the SHAâ€‘1 Collision Finder is designed to parse `.pdf` files, whereas Breakâ€‘OTS works best with plainâ€‘text `.txt` data. Providing the right file type prevents parsing errors and guarantees accurate results.
